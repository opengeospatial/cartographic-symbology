== Requirements Class "Basic Vector Features Styling"

=== Overview

This requirements class adds support for defining how to Fill and render the Stroke of vector geometry.
In addition, it defines the ability to specify a Marker consisting of one or more Graphic, to be
rendered at the exact location of point geometry, at the centroid of polygon geometry, or at each point of line geometry.

==== Symbolizer extension for vector features

[#img-uml-class-vectorFeaturesSymbolizer]
.Basic Vector Features Extended Symbolizer Class UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
class Symbolizer <<extended>>
Symbolizer : fill: Fill [0..1]
Symbolizer : stroke: Stroke [0..1]
Symbolizer : marker: Marker [0..1]
Symbolizer --* Fill
Symbolizer --* Stroke
Symbolizer --* Marker
....

The following three new Symbolizer properties are defined by this requirements class:

.Symbolizer class (vector features extension)
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name   | Definition                                                       | Data type and value  | Multiplicity
| fill   | Fill to fill inside of geometries                                | Fill                 | 0..1
| stroke | Stroke to render geometry outlines                               | Stroke               | 0..1
| marker | Marker to render at geometries points or centroid (for polygons) | Marker               | 0..1
|===

==== Extended Identifiers for vector features

This requirements class defines as valid identifiers all of the accessible properties for a feature being portrayed with the name of those properties being the text of the identifier.
Those identifiers are to be resolved with the value of that property.
An encoding must support an escaping mechanism in cases where the name of a feature property might clash with a syntactic element.

===== Extended System Identifiers

[#img-uml-class-vector-systemIDs]
.Vector Features System Identifiers UML Class Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
class SystemIdentifierExpression <<extended>>
SystemIdentifierExpression : feature
SystemIdentifierExpression : feature.identifier
SystemIdentifierExpression : feature.geometryDimensions
SystemIdentifierExpression : dataLayer.features
SystemIdentifierExpression : dataLayer.featuresGeometryDimensions
SystemIdentifierExpression --> Feature
SystemIdentifierExpression --> DataLayer

Feature : identifier: string
Feature : geometryDimensions: int

DataLayer : features: Feature[*]
DataLayer : featuresGeometryDimensions: int
DataLayer --* Feature
....

In addition, the following new System Identifiers are defined by this requirements class:

.System identifiers for vector features
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name                                  | Definition                                               | Data type and value
| feature.identifier                    | Identifier of a particular feature                       | string or number
| feature.geometryDimensions            | Dimension of geometry for a particular feature           | 0 (points), 1 (lines), 2 (polygons), 3 (polyhedrons)
| dataLayer.featuresGeometryDimension   | Dimension of feature geometry (if same for all features) | 0 (points), 1 (lines), 2 (polygons), 3 (polyhedrons), `null` (mixed)
|===

==== Colors

[#img-uml-class-color]
.Color class UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
Color : r: float
Color : g: float
Color : b: float
....

Both the Fill and Stroke allow to define a Color, specified using red, green and blue components.
The ability to define Colors in other spaces (e.g., Lab, CMYK) is defined in separate requirements classes
and applies wherever this basic RGB Color class is used.

.Color class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name   | Definition       | Type   | Multiplicity
| r       | Red component   | float  | 1
| g       | Green component | float  | 1
| b       | Blue component  | float  | 1
|===

==== Fills

[#img-uml-class-fill]
.UML Class Diagram of the Symbology Fill
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
Fill : color: Color
Fill : opacity: float
Fill --* Color
....

A Fill defines the graphical symbolizing parameters required to draw the filling of a two-dimensional shape such as a polygon.
Separate conformance classes can extend this Fill class with additional properties.

.Fill class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name    | Definition          | Type    | Multiplicity
| color   | Color of the fill   | Color   | 0..1
| opacity | Opacity of the fill | float   | 0..1
|===

==== Strokes

[#img-uml-class-stroke]
.Stroke Class UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
Stroke --|> StrokeStyling
Stroke --* StrokeStyling

StrokeStyling : color: Color
StrokeStyling : opacity: float
StrokeStyling : width: float
StrokeStyling : widthUnit: GraphicalUnit
StrokeStyling --* Color
StrokeStyling --* GraphicalUnit
....

A Stroke defines the graphical symbolizing parameters for drawing an outline (e.g., for linear geometries or the exterior of a polygon geometry). As an abstract class and part of the base of the core graphical concepts, StrokeClass is a global point of extension to specify concrete ways to draw outlines (e.g., the PenStroke and GraphicStroke extensions). The StrokeClass properties are documented in the following table.

A Stroke object inherits from a base _StrokeStyling_ class, which is re-used in a separate requirements class for defining more complex strokes:

.StrokeStyling class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name      | Definition                           | Data type and value   | Multiplicity
| color     | Color of the stroke                  | Color                 | 0..1
| width     | Width of the stroke                  | float (uom-qualified) | 0..1
|===

===== Graphical Units of Measure

[#img-uml-class-graphicalunits]
.Graphical Units Enumeration UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
class GraphicalUnit <<enumeration>>
GraphicalUnit : pixels
GraphicalUnit : meters
GraphicalUnit : feet
GraphicalUnit : percent
GraphicalUnit : points
GraphicalUnit : em
GraphicalUnit : screenInches
GraphicalUnit : screenCM
GraphicalUnit : screenMM
....

For styling parameters that define sizing and positioning of graphical objects (width, displacement, etc.), a specific unit of measure needs to be provided for the rendering engine.
Therefore, properties where a unit of measure is relevant can be qualified with a particular uom codes.

Below is the list of allowed units of measure as per UCUM (except for pixel):

* portrayal units: pixel, millimeter, inch, percentage; and
* ground units: meter, foot.

The portrayal unit “pixel” is the default unit of measure.
If available, the pixel size depends on the viewer client resolution, otherwise it is equal to 0.28mm x 0.28mm (~ 90 DPI).

// TODO: Review the list of supported units.
//       Should we support 'pt' as well to scale with font sizes ? (e.g., large font accessibiity mode)
//       Is percentage relevant?

////
TOCHECK: Do we need the ability to inherit a uom from a parent object?

Consequently, either the unit of measure is determined through the uom code directly associated to each element or it is determined by the innermost parent uom code
(e.g., an uom code defined at the Symbolizer level implies that this unit is applied for all sizing and positioning values inside the Symbolizer).
////

==== Markers

[#img-uml-class-marker]
.Marker Class UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
Marker --|> MultiGraphic

MultiGraphic : elements: Graphic [0..*]
MultiGraphic --* Graphic

Graphic : position: UnitPoint
Graphic : opacity: float
....

A Marker inherits from a MultiGraphic which can contain multiple graphical elements:

.MultiGraphic class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name      | Definition        | Data type and value   | Multiplicity
| elements  | Children elements | Graphic               | 1..*
|===

Without support for the _Multi Graphics and Transforms_ requirements class, a MultiGraphic cannot contain another MultiGraphic.

A MultiGraphic itself inherits from a Graphic allowing to specify an opacity and a 2D position:

.Graphic class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name      | Definition  | Data type and value | Multiplicity
| opacity   | Opacity     | float               | 0..1
| position  | Position    | UnitPoint           | 0..1
|===

////
The Graphic class defines the parameters for drawing a graphic symbol such as shape, color(s), and size.
A graphic can be informally defined as “a little picture” and can be either a bitmap or scaled vector (the term “graphic” is used instead of the term “symbol” to avoid confusion with Symbolizer,
which is used in a different context in this model). As an abstract class and part of the base of the core graphical concepts, GraphicClass is a global point of extension to specify concrete ways
to draw “graphic symbol” (e.g., ExternalGraphic and MarkGraphic extensions).
The GraphicClass properties are documented in the following table.

.Graphic class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name         | Definition                                                              | Data type and value     | Multiplicity
| uom          | Unit of measure to apply to all graphical properties within a Graphic   | uom code                | zero or one
| graphicSize  | Rendering size of the graphic                                           | GraphicSize data type   | zero or one
| extension    | Any encoding should allow to extend a Graphic with custom items         | Any type                | zero or more
|===

The GraphicSize class determines the size of the graphic when it is rendered.
As an abstract class, it is designed to be extended to support the various ways the size could be specified such as by a single value, a rectangular box,
or by a three-dimensional cube. The GraphicSize properties are documented in the following table.

.GraphicSize class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name   | Definition   | Data type and value   | Multiplicity
| extension   | Any encoding should allow to extend a GraphicSize with custom items   | Any type   | zero or more
|===

////

.UnitPoint class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name      | Definition           | Data type and value   | Multiplicity
| x         | Horizontal position  | float (uom-qualified) | 1
| y         | Vertical position    | float (uom-qualified) | 1
|===

===== Dot Graphics

[#img-uml-class-dot]
.Dot Class UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
Dot --|> Shape
Dot : point: UnitPoint
Dot --* UnitPoint

class Shape <<abstract>>
Shape --|> Graphic
Shape : stroke: Stroke [0..1]
Shape --* Stroke
....

A round Dot is one type of Graphic defined by this requirements class that can be used as part of a Marker.

A Dot inherits from a Shape class allowing to define a `stroke` which controls the color and size of the dot (with the stroke's `width` property).

.Shape
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name       | Definition                                    | Type     | Multiplicity
| stroke     | Stroke with which to render the shape outline | Stroke | 0..1
|===

| hotSpot        | 0,0 position in the image       | UnitPoint (uom-qualified) | 1
| tint           | Tint (multiplying white)        | Color                     | 1
| blackTint      | Black tint (used for black      | Color                     | 1
| alphaThreshold | Alpha value considered pickable | float                     | 1
|===

The actual image content is defined by a Resource, which can be specified by one or multiple properties:

.Resource class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name           | Definition                                  | Type     | Multiplicity

....


A Text is one type of Graphic defined by this requirements class that can be used as part of a Marker.

.Text
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name           | Definition                        | Data type and value   | Multiplicity
| text           | The character string for the text | string (unicode)*     | 1

| alignment      | The alignment to use for the text | TextAlignment         | 0..1
|===

This requirements class requires support for identifier parameter value expression for the `text` property without any additional requirements class.
This allows to display the value of feature properties with a Text Marker.
