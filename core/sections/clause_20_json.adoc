== Requirements Class "JSON Styles and Symbology"

=== Overview

This requirements class defines a JSON encoding for the Styles and Symbology Logical Model.
The primary objective of this encoding is to be readily parsable and writable by machines using a standard JSON parser.
Styles encoded with this encoding are not easily hand-edited by cartographers.

The encoding of expressions for both selectors and symbolizer parameter values in this encoding is based on the CQL2-JSON encoding.

In order to represent a partial update to an object property of a symbolizer, an object with all the modified properties is
specified, as well as setting the `"alter"` property to `true`. For example, the following is equivalent to the _CartoSym CSS_ representation of
`fill.color.r: 100`, and will preserve the values of the other fill properties as well as the green and blue component of the fill color set
 by earlier rules or specified by defaults:

```json
"fill": {
   "alter": true,
   "color": {
      "alter": true,
      "r": 100
   }
}
```

A similar mechanism is also defined to modify only some elements of an array by using an object with `"index"` set to the zero-based array index,
and `"value"` set to new value with which to update that array element. This mechanism can be combined with the partial update of objects
to only modify some properties of an object array element, or to partially modify an array inside of an object property.
For example, the following is equivalent to the _CartoSym CSS_ representation of
`marker.elements[1]: Text { text: "Marker" }`:

```json
"marker": {
   "alter": true,
   "elements": {
      "index": 1,
      "value": { "type": "Text", "text": "Marker" }
   }
}
```

Variables are encoded as JSON Pointer to a top-level `"$variables"` section in the same source file, or in an included file e.g.,
`{ "$ref": "#/$variables/myVariable" }`.
Base style sheets can be included using an "$include" property in the top-level object followed by either a single relative file path string
or an array of relative file path strings to include. The styling rules from the included files will be included before any styling rules
defined by the current file, allowing to override the symbolization fully or partially.

==== Example

The following example demonstrates the CartoSym JSON encoding for the same example Basic Vector Styling for polygons equivalent to the one seen in
the following CartoSym CSS section (Example 1 in 21.1.8.1. Basic Vector Styling).

[source,json,options="unnumbered"]

==== JSON Schema

The following JSON Schema describes the encoding.
