== some illustrations

This annexe give a set of illustrations to prevent any ambiguity and
make everything comprehensible the best we can.

=== GraphicFill

​The following figure illustrates two examples using GraphicFill. The
nested graphic is a simple 5mm wide light-orange circle. In a) the
GraphicFill only defines the circle and, in b), a TileGap of 1mm in both
directions is added.

Notice, the tiling shall be consistent between neighboring features.
Moreover, tiles shall be organized according to a system-dependent
geographic anchor point, which implies each feature is filled by the
pattern in a unique way at a given scale level, as shown in next figure.

​The features are always filled in the same way at a given scale,
whatever the map bounding-box is.

=== HatchedFill

The following figure illustrates the effect inducted by adding an offset
(no offset in a), offset in b)).

{empty}a) illustrates how hatches shall be generated according to an
anchor-point. b) shows the same but with the addition of an offset

=== PerpendicularOffset

NOTE: Add a figure here. To be titled: Positive and negative perpendicular offset against a 2-dimensional geometry

=== RelativeOrientation

RelativeOrientation tells what angle to rotate the graphic to when it is
plotted. Allowed values are “normal” (default) meaning rotated to the
mathematical normal (perpendicular) of the line at the plotting point,
“line” which means to rotate to the direction of the line at the
plotting point, “portrayal” which means always upright with respect to
the parent portrayal environment (usually the map), and “normalUp” which
means to rotate with respect to the normal of the line, but rotate an
additional 180 degrees if the graphic would otherwise end up pointing
downward with respect to the parent portrayal environment.
