== Overview

The FeatureType Style extensions provide a set of concrete Symbology
Core Model implementations to renderer 2D features (eg. vector data).

The extensions are organized as packages (<<img_ft_style>>).

**Requirement Class:
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/FeatureTypeStyle[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/FeatureTypeStyle_]

**Scope: **All requirements in this subsection relate to the above
requirement class.

*Dependencies:*
http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/core[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/core_]

*Description:* The FeatureTypeStyle extension defines the styling that
is to be applied to a single feature type.

*Requirement ID:*
http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/FeatureTypeStyleClass[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/FeatureTypeStyleClass_]** +
Requirement Txt:** Implementations shall support the encoding of all
parameters of the FeatureTypeStyleClass and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

This class extends the abstract Style class described in the core. It
defines the ability to portray a Layer built of N instances of GML
AbstractFeatureType (Portele, 2007) with the ability to access features
according to Simple Feature SF-2 (Van den Brink et al., 2012).

The rendering engine is driven according to the following execution: all
features are applied to each symbolizer in sequence as they appear
nested in rule and following the “painters model” with the first item in
a list being the first item plotted and hence being on the “bottom”.

The FilteredRule extension extends the Rule class with a property
(Filter) to specify a filter mechanism. It is "used to identify a subset
of resources from a collection of resources whose property values
satisfy a set of logically connected predicates. If the property values
of a resource satisfy all the predicates in a filter then that resource
is considered to be part of the resulting subset"^footnote:[ from
http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/FES/2.0/clause/7.1]^ such as a subset of
features to style by applying a given Symbolizer. An encoding shall
offer a mechanism to select features according to a where clause using
comparison and logical operators and additional functions (see
ParameterValue subclause). More explanations about the filtering
mechanism in link:#_tfvpwf4g1vr[_Annexe B - FilteredRule_].

**Requirement Class:
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/AreaSymbolizer[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/AreaSymbolizer_]

**Scope: **All requirements in this subsection relate to the above
requirement class.

**Dependency:
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/core[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/core_]

*Requirement ID:*

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the AreaSymbolizer extension and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

An AreaSymbolizer is used to symbolize a geometry into an area including
filling its interior and stroking its outline. It is typically used for
a 2-dimensional geometry (e.g. Polygon).

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Name |Definition |Data type and value |Multiplicity

|fill |Filling style to draw the interior area |Fill data type |Zero or
one

|stroke |Stroke style to draw the outline |Stroke data type |Zero or one
|===

[loweralpha]
. If a geometry has “holes,” then they are not filled, but the borders
around the holes are stroked in the usual way if a Stroke parameter is
mentioned. “Islands” within holes are filled and stroked, and so on. If
a point is used, then a small, square, orthogonal-normal area should be
constructed for rendering. If a line is used, then the line (string) is
closed for filling (only) by connecting its end point to its start
point, any line crossings are corrected in some way, and only the
original line is stroked.
. A missing Fill property means that the geometry will not be filled. A
missing Stroke property means that the geometry will not be stroked.
When both are used, the filling is rendered first and then the stroking
rendered on top of the filling.

==== LineSymbolizer extension

**Requirement class:
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/AreaSymbolizer[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/LineSymbolizer_]

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the LineSymbolizer extension and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

​The LineSymbolizer extension is used to symbolize a geometry into a
stroke, typically along an 1-dimensional geometry, such as a LineString.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Name |Definition |Data type and value |Multiplicity
|stroke |Stroke style to draw the line |Stroke data type |one
|===

[loweralpha]
. For a 0-dimensional geometry (e.g. point) the stroke is applied on a
line of “epsilon” length (arbitrarily small) with a horizontal
orientation centered on the rendered geometry with two end caps. For a
2-dimensional geometry (e.g. polygon) the stroke is applied on its
closed outline as the line rendered with no end caps.

==== PointSymbolizer extension

The PointSymbolizer extension is used to symbolize a geometry into a
point at which a graphic is placed.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Name |Definition |Data type and value |Multiplicity
|graphic |Graphic to draw at the point |Graphic data type |One

[loweralpha]
. For a geometry type other than 0-dimensional (e.g. a line, polygon)
the semantic is to compute and use a representative interior central
point as the point placement (i.e. guaranteed to lie on the line or the
surface interior).

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the GraphicFill class and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

The GraphicFill extension is a concrete implementation of the Fill
class. It repeats a rectangular tiling pattern over an area (i.e.
mosaïc). A graphic can be defined very informally as “a little picture”.
The appearance of the graphic is defined with the embedded Graphic class
parameter.

The graphic fill repeats the Graphic in a rectangular tiling pattern
with a TileGap between tiles. The TileGap parameter allows to define
vertical and horizontal gaps between tiles.

[cols=",,,",]

|===

[loweralpha]
. Hatching is defined by a juxtaposed hatches. A hatch is rendered by a
Stroke and oriented given an Angle. The Distance parameter defines the
perpendicular space between two consecutive hatches. +
Hatches are organized according to a reference line which is defined as
the line that crosses a system-dependent anchor point and is oriented
given the provided Angle. Also, the complementary Offset parameter
allows to move the anchor point according to a displacement in the
direction of value Angle+90° (see link:#_z186k8oiqz0b[_Annexe B -
GraphicFill_]).
. Clockwise is the rotation of Angle because of the coordinate system of
the view box with X axis advancing to the right of the origin and the Y
axis advancing downward.

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the PenStroke class and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

The PenStroke extension is a concrete implementation of the Stroke
class. It allows to draw a line (e.g. a 1-dimensional geometry, the
outline of a marker, etc) analogously to how a pen is used with ink,
that is to say by filling the area formed by the thickness of the line.

[cols=",,,",]

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the GraphicStroke class and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

The GraphicStroke extension is a concrete implementation of the Stroke
class. It is about one graphic repeated along a line. A renderer may
apply some aesthetic embellishments like trying to bend a graphic around
corners or avoid a graphic to be cut at the start or at the end.

[cols=",,,",]
|===
|Name |Definition |Data type and value |Multiplicity

|graphic |The graphic to plot |Graphic data type |one

|length |Linear length to reserve along the line to plot a single
graphic (a) a|
ParameterValue data type (Float)

Value: [0;+∞)

Default: graphic natural length

|zero or one
|===

[loweralpha]
. The Length property specifies the linear length to reserve along the
line for one of the repeated graphics to plot. By default, the linear
length is equal to the Graphic natural length (which depends on the view
box of the graphic). It has the effect to perfectly juxtapose the
repeated graphics all along the line. Zero length value means the
graphic is not repeated within all the available linear space. Notice
that a single graphic is not plotted if the size of the available linear
space smaller than the Length.

===== TextStroke extension

**Requirement class:
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/TextStroke[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/TextStroke_]

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of all
properties of the TextStroke class and meet all of the tabulated
constraints and notes.

The TextStroke extension is a concrete implementation of the Stroke
class. It is about the repetition of a text label along a line in a
similar way GraphicStroke does by repeating a graphic. The text glyphs
are plotted as integral rotated units following the line.

[cols=",,,",]

ParameterValue data type (Float)

Value: [0;+∞)

Default: label natural length

|zero or one
|===

[loweralpha]
. The Length parameter specifies the linear length to reserve along the
line for one of the repeated labels to plot. By default, the linear
length is equal to the label natural length (which depends on the
LalbelText and Font configurations extensions). It has the effect to
perfectly juxtapose the repeated labels all along the line. Zero length
value means the label is not repeated.

[loweralpha]
. There are three ways to define a mark shape, either using
WellKnownName, OnlineResource or InlineContent. They can't be defined
together.
. WellKnownName is used to draw predefined internal marks. The center of
the view box is the default anchor point, except for star and triangle.
. OnlineResource and InlineContent are two ways to select a mark from an
external mark archive (e.g. glyph from TrueType or SVG font). The
MarkIndex property represents a numeric identifier which allows an
individual mark in a mark archive to be selected. The default anchor
point is format-dependent, while the center of the view box shall be
used if no information is available.
. A missing Fill parameter means that the geometry will not be filled. A
missing Stroke parameter means that the geometry will not be stroked.
When both are used, the filling is rendered first and then the stroking
rendered on top of the filling. A missing Halo parameter means no halo
is drawn.
. The encoding must describe the order in which transformations are
executed.

The extension introduces also WellKnownName code list extension, used to
draw predefined shape of mark graphics. It includes the following codes
: square, circle, triangle, star, cross, x.

*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of the
added property of the LineSymbolizer extension and meet all of the
tabulated constraints and notes.

For a LineSymbolizer, the distance between original geometry and drawn
line stays equal. This construction can result in drawn lines that are
actually smaller or longer than the original geometry. The distance is
in the context of the UnitOfMeasure property and is positive to the
left-hand side of the line string. Negative numbers mean right (see
link:#_pkauxqlap12e[_Annexe B - PerpendicularOffset_]).

*Requirement ID:*
http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/style/LineSymbolizerExtension[_http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/AreaSymbolizerClass_]http://www.opengis.net/spec/symbology/2.0/req/LinePerpendicularOffset[_/PerpendicularOffset_] +
*Requirement Txt:* Implementations shall support the encoding of the
added property of the AreaSymbolizer extension and meet all of the
tabulated constraints and notes.

For a AreaSymbolizer, the extension allows to shrink or grow the area
impacting both the stroking of the outline and the filling of the area.
The distance is in the context of the UnitOfMeasure parameter and is
positive to the outside of the polygon. Negative numbers mean drawing
the polygon smaller (see link:#_pkauxqlap12e[_Annexe B -
PerpendicularOffset_]).

Requirement Txt:** Implementations shall support the encoding of the
added property of the TextSymbolizer extension and meet all of the
tabulated constraints and notes.

For a TextSymbolizer, the extension has the same meaning as for
LineSymbolizer and for AreaSymbolizer, but can be ignored for punctual
geometry. Before symbolizing the geometry into a text label, the
geometry is transformed according to a perpendicular offset which
produces a parallel line. The text label is then drawn according to that
parallel line.

The label is aligned vertically. Relative to the placement point, it is
either aligned at the top, at the bottom, through its middle line or
through its baseline (see link:#_p4awyw17d0uv[_Annexe B -
LabelAlignment_]).

The label is aligned horizontally. Relative to the placement point, it
is either drawn at the left, centered, or at the right (see
link:#_p4awyw17d0uv[_Annexe B - LabelAlignment_]).

VerticalAlignement is a preference hint of where to draw vertically the
label relative to the placement line. It is drawn either aligned at the
top, at the bottom, through its middle line or through its baseline.

HorizontalAlignment is a preference hint of where to draw horizontally
the label along the placement line. It is aligned either at the left
(start point side), at the right (end point side) or centered to the
line.

The semantic of top, middle, bottom, baseline, left, center and right is
relative to the orientation of the curve.
